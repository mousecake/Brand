        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Maurice Searcy. I'm currently currently self-employed as a car builder, stunt driver, and caregiver to my family . I just finished completing my Bachelors is Graphic Information Technology (GIT). I entered ASU's GIT program after finishing my enlistment in the US Army. I attended ASU using the Post 9/11 GI Bill. I was assigned to the storied 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment and deployed to Mosul, Iraq, in support of Iraqi Freedom 2007-2009. There is a Wikipedia page about this unit that covers all the conflicts this unit participated in since its formation in 1846. During deployment I earned a Combat Action Badge, and after enlistment I received the Army Achievement Medal for honorable enlistment.</p>
